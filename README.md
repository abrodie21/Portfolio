# Design Portfolio

Here are two designs of personal projects that I have completed during my undergrad.

Design 1: Heartbeat Detection device, utilizing an IR emitter/sensor to measure the density of blood in a finger, signal processing to blink an LED with the hearbeat.

-This project was originally a Circuits II Lab project at Purdue (2k8) that I expanded upon to include a PCB schematic that can be fabricated.

Design 2: Powered Device sensor, utilizing a differential coil setup to detect magnetic fields in close proximity generated by transformers in power adapters. 

-Designed to be cheap and cost effective, utilizing a 1 layer PCB and as few components as possible.
