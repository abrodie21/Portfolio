# Heartbeat-Sensor
Heartbeat Detection device, utilizing an IR emitter/sensor to measure the density of blood in a finger, signal processing to blink an LED with the hearbeat.

This project was originally a Circuits II Lab project at Purdue (2k8) that I expanded upon to include a PCB schematic that can be fabricated.
